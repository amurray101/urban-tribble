      <p> We, her three splendid children, have decided to compile this website because we love her very much and wanted to make her something she would be able to access from her phone, iPad, Twitter, or other internet connected device. :) </p>

      <p> Swam thank you so much for all that you do for me every day. From helping me fight through the housing drama at Penn to going to the ballet with me, I always know you are just a phone call away (provided that you kindly lend me money to pay my phone bill). After a summer of doing all my own cooking, I have a newfound appreciation for your cooking skills. You are also the hardest worker I know and while I don't envy your lack of sleep, I do envy your work ethic. While I definitely don't say it enough, I am incredibly grateful for everything that you do. I'm so glad of all the moms in the world I got you. </p>
